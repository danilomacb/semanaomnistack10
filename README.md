This repo contains 3 projects (backend, frontend, and mobile), and you need to install all dependencies from each one, so enter in each folder project and run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

# Running

Remember, the backend uses MongoDB to store data, so you will need him installed and executing. For mobile, you will need an emulator ou just a cellphone to run the expo, if you don't have an emulator installed and configured follow this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSjFDWYkdxM). To run the mobile, you will also need expo-cli installed globally. After all, configured you will need to run all the projects:

```bash
# /semanaomnistack10/backend
$ npm run dev

# /semanaomnistack10/frontend
$ npm start

# /semanaomnistack10/mobile
$ expo start
```

The expo will open a page in your browser, after this click on `Run on Android device/emulator` with the emulator open.
